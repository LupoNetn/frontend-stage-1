            <p>
              Hello! I’m <strong>Daniel Lupo</strong>, a passionate software
              engineering student at Obafemi Awolowo University. I’m driven by
              curiosity, creativity, and a deep love for building digital
              experiences that make people’s lives easier. My journey in tech
              started with simple HTML and CSS pages, and now I’m exploring the
              world of JavaScript, React, and AI-powered applications.

            <h2 class="about-subheading">Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>
              While I’m confident in building UI components and handling state,
              I sometimes struggle with debugging complex logic and structuring
              large-scale React applications efficiently. I’m also working on
              becoming more consistent with documentation and version control
              practices.

            <p>
              Dear future Daniel, always remember why you started — to create,
              to learn, and to make an impact. Keep pushing boundaries, stay
              humble, and never stop exploring. The challenges you face today
              are shaping you into the engineer you’re meant to be.

            <p>
              This program has been a major stepping stone for me. It’s taught
              me the importance of perseverance, community, and continuous
              learning. My biggest takeaway so far is that consistency always
              wins — even slow progress is still progress.
